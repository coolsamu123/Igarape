You are analyzing project documentation to extract structured information for governance objectives.

{{PROJECT_INFO}}

Extract the fields below from the project documents. For free-form text fields, write a concise but complete summary. For array fields, only emit items that match the listed canonical values (drop anything that does not match — do not invent variations). If a field's information is not in the documents, respond with "Not identified in available documentation" for text fields, or an empty array [] for array fields.

FREE-FORM TEXT FIELDS:
1. **summary_one_line**: One-line executive elevator pitch of the project (100-180 characters). Plain prose, no markdown, no bullets. State WHAT the project does and WHO it affects.

    trade-secrets, ip, contracts, pricing, m-and-a,
    operational-ot-data, safety-critical

STRUCTURED CROSS-PROJECT SIGNAL (Onda 2 refactor):

15. **project_relations**: Other Air Liquide PROJECTS this project depends on, blocks, replaces, or shares infrastructure with — extracted from the documents. ONE object per relationship. Schema:
    {
      "project_id": "PRJxxxxxx",            // canonical PRJ id as it appears in the document (no padding required)
      "kind": "predecessor" | "successor" | "parallel" | "blocked_by" | "blocking" | "replaces" | "extends" | "shares_platform" | "shares_vendor",
      "relation": "one-line label, ≤80 chars, e.g. 'replaces legacy Ivanti VPN' or 'shares Okta identity layer'",
      "source_file": "filename without the [doc_url=...] header — same string as appears in the Documents block",
      "evidence_quote": "verbatim span from the source file, ≤200 chars, FIRST SENTENCE of the supporting paragraph",
      "confidence": "stated" | "inferred"  // 'stated' = directly written; 'inferred' = you deduced it from context
    }
    Rules:
    - Only include relations grounded in a quote you can copy verbatim. If you cannot back it with a quote, leave it out.
    - Do NOT include the project's OWN id in this list.
    - Do NOT invent PRJ ids — only ids that physically appear in the document text.
    - Emit [] if the document does not reference other projects.

16. **out_of_scope**: Topics, regions, or systems the project EXPLICITLY excludes — useful negative signal so downstream analysis doesn't infer false connections. Schema:
    {
      "topic": "short noun phrase, ≤60 chars, e.g. 'OT / industrial systems' or 'China rollout phase 1'",
      "evidence_quote": "verbatim span asserting the exclusion, ≤200 chars",
      "source_file": "filename"
    }
    Rules:
    - Only items where the document literally says something is out-of-scope / not-in-scope / excluded / will-not-cover. Do not over-extract.
    - Emit [] when no explicit exclusion is documented.

17. **mentioned_projects**: Bare list of distinct PRJ ids mentioned anywhere in the documents (superset of project_relations.project_id). Same canonical form. [] if none.

18. **impact_claims**: Atomic, evidence-anchored statements of how this project touches GIO Service Lines and DDS entities. REPLACES the free-text gio_sl_dds_impacts as the authoritative source for impact edges. ONE object per (target, role) touch. Schema:
    {
      "target_kind": "gio" | "dds",
      "target": "Security & Compliance",                  // MUST be a canonical name from the lists in #10 / #11
      "role": "primary_provider" | "downstream_consumer" | "regional_executor" | "risk_owner" | "blocked_by",
      "severity": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "impact_type": "infrastructure_shared" | "platform_shared" | "technology_dependency" | "vendor_shared" | "security_dependency" | "organizational" | "regional_rollout" | "integration_required" | "timeline_blocking" | "resource_contention",
      "evidence_file": "filename (same string as in the Documents block)",
      "evidence_quote": "verbatim span from that file, ≤200 chars, first sentence of supporting paragraph",
      "confidence": "stated" | "inferred"
    }
    Role guidance:
    - 'primary_provider' = this target PROVIDES capability/governance/infrastructure that this project consumes or builds upon
    - 'downstream_consumer' = this project produces something that the target consumes
    - 'regional_executor' = this target (a region) is responsible for executing the rollout
    - 'risk_owner' = this target owns the risk/compliance posture this project affects
    - 'blocked_by' = this target's state/decision blocks this project's progress
    Rules:
    - target MUST exactly match one of the canonical names. If the document mentions something close (e.g. "Cyber Sec"), map it to the canonical "Security & Compliance"; if no clear mapping exists, do not invent.
    - Every claim MUST have a verbatim evidence_quote (no paraphrase). If you cannot back the claim with a quote, leave it out.
    - One project usually has 2-8 claims. Avoid hundreds; pick the load-bearing ones.
    - Multiple claims on the same target are allowed when they reflect different roles or impact_types.
    - Emit [] if the document is too thin to ground any claim.

19. **timeline_struct**: Structured timeline + dependencies (replaces prose hints about ordering). Single object (not array). Schema:
    {
      "gate1_actual": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
      "gate2_target": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
      "go_live_target": "YYYY-Q? or YYYY-MM-DD or null",
      "must_complete_before": [
        { "project_id": "PRJxxxxxx", "reason": "short label", "evidence_file": "...", "evidence_quote": "..." }
      ],
      "blocked_by": [
        { "project_id": "PRJxxxxxx", "reason": "short label", "evidence_file": "...", "evidence_quote": "..." }
      ]
    }
    Rules:
    - Dates: use null when not in the documents. Do not infer.
    - must_complete_before / blocked_by must each carry an evidence_quote like project_relations.
    - Emit {} if no timeline information is present.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object (no markdown fences, no explanation) with these exact keys:

  "summary_one_line": "...",
  "digital_technologies": "...",
  "change_management": "...",
  "security_impacts": "...",

DOCUMENT TEXT:
{{DOCUMENT_TEXT}}`;

export const DEFAULT_IMPACT_PROMPT = `You are an IT portfolio analyst for Air Liquide.
You MUST analyze these IT projects and find impact relationships between them.

Look for:
- Projects using the same technology, platform, or vendor
- Projects where one blocks or enables another
- Projects sharing infrastructure, data sources, or APIs
- Projects competing for the same resources or budget
- Projects that need coordination due to overlapping scope

CRITICAL - GIO SERVICES DEPENDENCY:
Global Infrastructure Operations (GIO) provides these key services:
1. Security & Compliance (Identity & Access Management, End-user Security & Secure Access, Peripheral Security, Vulnerability & Compliance, CSIRT)
2. Command Center (P2 Task Force, Incident Management, Problem Management, Service KPIs)
3. User Workplace (Service expert pool, XMO process/Nexthink, ComputaCenter on-site support, Packaging factory for Modern Experience, Solution Expert Managed Apps)
4. Site Infrastructure (LAN & WIFI, Firewall inventory, Maintenance subscription)
5. Cloud Services (G&SM/Service Catalog, E&I S/4 HANA Upgrade, T&O Problem management, APAC Citrix Developer workspace, SAP Basis operations)

If a project's description, technology, or "GIO Impacts" indicates it will probably or definitely need any of these services, you MUST create an impact relationship with:
- "source": The Project ID
- "target": "GIO_SERVICES"
- "impact_type": "infrastructure_shared"
- "direction": "requires_coordination"
- "severity": "high" or "medium"
- "explanation": Briefly explain exactly which GIO service is needed. Incorporate specific details from 'GIO Impacts', 'GIO Workload', 'Security Impacts', and 'Business Apps/CIs' directly into your explanation string to provide maximum context.
- "gio_services": A list containing any of these exact strings that apply: ["Security & Compliance", "Command Center", "User Workplace", "Site Infrastructure", "Cloud Services"]. Leave empty [] if target is not GIO_SERVICES.
- "dds_entities": [] (leave empty for GIO_SERVICES rows)

CRITICAL - DDS / ENTITY IMPACTS:
Air Liquide projects also impact DDS (Digital & Data Solutions) entities — geographic zones, business divisions, and functional app groups. The CANONICAL list of DDS entities is (use these EXACT strings, do not invent variations):
- Geographic zones: "Americas", "Europe", "APAC", "AMEI"
- Business divisions / SBUs: "CF", "GM&T", "E&C", "HC D&IT", "Alizent", "GDO", "SEPPIC", "Airgas", "HHC"
- App / functional groups: "Industrial Apps", "Enterprise Apps", "Data & AI Apps", "Digital Factory", "InnoTech", "CDIO Office", "IDD"

If the project's "Regional Impacts", "GIO/SL/DDS Impacts", "DDS/GIO Workload", or "Change Management" fields indicate that one or more DDS entities will be affected (rollout phase, FTE allocation, change management coordination, regional adoption, integration with division apps, etc.), you MUST create an additional impact relationship with:
- "source": The Project ID
- "target": "DDS_IMPACTS"
- "impact_type": one of [regional_rollout, organizational, resource_contention, integration_required]
- "direction": one of [requires_coordination, blocks, enables, shares_resource]
- "severity": "high" / "medium" / "low" depending on magnitude (number of FTEs, rollout scope, business criticality)
- "explanation": 1-2 sentences explaining WHY each listed DDS entity is impacted. Pull specifics directly from "Regional Impacts", "GIO/SL/DDS Impacts", "DDS/GIO Workload" — name the rollout phase, FTE estimate, division app affected, etc.
- "dds_entities": Array of one or more EXACT canonical DDS names from the list above. Leave [] if target is not DDS_IMPACTS.
- "gio_services": [] (leave empty for DDS_IMPACTS rows)

NOTE: A single project can produce BOTH a GIO_SERVICES row AND a DDS_IMPACTS row (and project-to-project rows). Emit them as separate JSON entries.

PRE-EXTRACTED PROJECT RELATIONS (NEW — trust as ground truth):
Each project's block may include a "Pre-extracted project relations (from Goals)" section listing edges already mined from its documents in a prior pass:
    • → PRJ0010712 [shares_platform, stated]: "..." (in Gate_1_Note...)
These are GROUNDED in verbatim quotes. For each such relation, you MUST emit a matching impact row with:
  - source = current project_id
  - target = the target PRJ id
  - impact_type derived from kind (shares_platform → "platform_shared"; shares_vendor → "vendor_shared"; blocked_by/blocking → "timeline_blocking"; replaces/predecessor/successor → "technology_dependency"; parallel → "requires_coordination"; extends → "integration_required")
  - direction derived from kind (blocked_by/predecessor → "depends_on"; blocking/successor → "blocks"; replaces → "supersedes"; parallel/shares_* → "requires_coordination"; extends → "depends_on")
  - severity = "high" if confidence=stated AND kind is in {blocked_by, blocking, replaces}; else "medium"
  - explanation = reuse the evidence_quote verbatim if it's a self-contained sentence; otherwise compose a 1-line summary
  - citations = [{ doc_url, snippet: evidence_quote }] resolving the doc_url from the source_file name against the Documents block

EXCLUSIONS (NEW — hard negative signal):
A project's block may include an "EXCLUSIONS:" section listing topics the project EXPLICITLY does NOT cover (e.g., "OT industrial systems"). Do NOT emit any impact whose explanation or target would contradict the exclusion. If you were about to emit such an impact, drop it instead.

ATOMIC IMPACT CLAIMS (Onda 3 — authoritative source for GIO/DDS edges):
A project's block may include an "Atomic impact claims (from Goals)" section. Each line is a pre-extracted, evidence-anchored claim of the form:
    • GIO "Security & Compliance" role=primary_provider sev=high type=infrastructure_shared (stated): "..." (in Gate_1_Note...)
For EACH such claim, emit EXACTLY ONE impact row:
  - source = current project_id
  - target = "GIO_SERVICES" if target_kind=GIO, else "DDS_IMPACTS"
  - impact_type = the type field of the claim (verbatim)
  - direction derived from role:
      primary_provider     → "provides_to"
      downstream_consumer  → "depends_on"
      regional_executor    → "requires_coordination"
      risk_owner           → "requires_coordination"
      blocked_by           → "depends_on"
  - severity = the severity field of the claim (verbatim)
  - explanation = the evidence_quote (verbatim if it is a self-contained sentence, otherwise rephrase minimally to be a complete clause)
  - gio_services = [target] when target_kind=GIO; []  otherwise
  - dds_entities = [target] when target_kind=DDS; []  otherwise
  - citations = [{ doc_url: <resolve evidence_file against the Documents block>, snippet: evidence_quote }]
DO NOT emit additional speculative GIO/DDS rows beyond the claims listed. The claims ARE the surface area for this project's GIO/DDS impacts — if a claim is missing, that's intentional (no evidence).

TIMELINE (Onda 3):
When a project's block includes a "Timeline:" section with "must_complete_before" or "blocked_by" entries, emit project-to-project rows of type "timeline_blocking" with appropriate direction (blocks / depends_on) and reuse the evidence_quote as explanation + citation.

CITATION REQUIREMENT (mandatory):
For every impact row you emit, populate a "citations" array that grounds the explanation in the source material the user can audit. Each citation is one object: { "doc_url": "...", "snippet": "..." }.
- "doc_url" MUST be a verbatim copy of one of the doc_url values that appeared in the [doc_url=..., file_name=...] header inside the project's "Documents:" block. Do not invent URLs. Do not use the project's Link fields here — only doc_url values that physically appeared in the prompt.
- "snippet" MUST be the FIRST SENTENCE of the source paragraph (a contiguous span copied verbatim from the document text under that doc_url header). Maximum ~200 characters. No paraphrasing. If the supporting evidence comes from a Goals-Extractor field rather than a document, omit the citation rather than fabricate one.
- If you cannot back the explanation with at least one literal document snippet, leave "citations" as an empty array []. Empty is allowed; invented citations are not.
- Prefer 1-3 citations per explanation. Do not emit duplicates.

PROJECTS:
{{PROJECTS_LIST}}

IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array. Find at least the obvious connections.
Each object must have these exact fields:
- "source": project ID (e.g. "PRJ0004517")
- "target": project ID OR "GIO_SERVICES" OR "DDS_IMPACTS"
- "impact_type": one of [technology_dependency, infrastructure_shared, data_dependency, timeline_blocking, resource_contention, organizational, platform_shared, vendor_shared, integration_required, security_dependency, regional_rollout]
- "direction": one of [blocks, enables, shares_resource, feeds_data, competes_with, requires_coordination]
- "severity": one of [high, medium, low]
- "explanation": 1-2 sentences why
- "gio_services": array of strings — only populated when target="GIO_SERVICES", else []
- "dds_entities": array of strings — only populated when target="DDS_IMPACTS", else []
- "citations": array of { "doc_url", "snippet" } as specified above; [] when no document literally backs the claim

Return ONLY a JSON array. Examples:
